# Tracks_Tavern_Data

## Segment 1
#### Overview
We have chosen to review the Tracks Tavern sales data on both food and drinks and see how they correlate with the local weather. This provides an opportunity to work with a client and scope out a project for a local business.

#### Team
Our team communicates via email and Slack to keep up to date. As well, we meet through Zoom to discuss in real time. We have each been assigned our branch to work with Jess Ilias as the individual approving merge request.

#### Description of Data Source
We received csv files provided directly from the client which were converted to sqlite. We sourced the weather data from openweather.org. Together we will union the data to create one massive data frame.
#### Questions/Scope
Initially the client wanted to see the sales and inventory analysis. As a team we decided to incorporate the weather data to see what liquors and food sold best in which season. We will further analyze the data to see how the liquors and food sales correlate with one another. As our data model, we are looking to use linear regression, unsupervised machine learning, and Facebook Prophet.
