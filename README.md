# Tracks_Tavern_Data

## Segment 1
#### Overview
We have chosen to review the Tracks Tavern sales data on both food and drinks and see how they correlate with the local weather. This provides an opportunity to work with a client and scope out a project for a local business.

#### Team
Our team communicates via email and Slack to keep up to date. As well, we meet through Zoom to discuss in real time. We have each been assigned our branch to work with Jess Ilias as the individual approving merge request.

#### Description of Data Source
We received csv files provided directly from the client which were converted to sqlite. We sourced the weather data from openweather.org. Together we will union the data to create one massive data frame.
#### Questions/Scope
Initially the client wanted to see the sales and inventory analysis. As a team we decided to incorporate the weather data to see what liquors and food sold best in which season. We will further analyze the data to see how the liquors and food sales correlate with one another. As our data model, we are looking to use linear regression, unsupervised machine learning, and Facebook Prophet.

### Update

For the initial stages of the final project, we gather the data from Tracks taverns as single week csv files for period starting February 2019 up to September 2021, which we concatenated into a single csv file containing all the weekly sales data.  
With the data into a single file, we performed an initial exploration into the data to have wide view of track taverns sales patterns. Create charts for weekly sales, pie chart of sales by liquor and food categories, plus word cloud to visualize most common items. These charts are shown below:
